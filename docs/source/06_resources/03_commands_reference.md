# Guide to CLI commands

> *Note:* This documentation is based on `Kedro 0.15.4`, if you spot anything that is incorrect then please create an [issue](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) or pull request.

The `kedro` command line interface (CLI) helps with reproducibility in projects by allowing you to associate a set of commands and dependencies with a target and then execute them from the command line when inside a Kedro project directory. All project related CLI commands should be run from the projectâ€™s root directory.

The supported commands are specified in the `kedro_cli.py` file. It is easy to extend `kedro_cli.py` by either modifying the file or injecting commands into it by using the [`plugin` framework](../04_user_guide/10_developing_plugins.md).

### Autocomplete

To allow your shell to autocomplete `kedro` commands, you can add the following to your `.bashrc` (or just run it on the command line)

```
eval "$(_KEDRO_COMPLETE=source kedro)"
```

## Global Kedro commands

Show version and exit:

```bash
kedro -V
kedro --version
```

See extensive logging and error stack traces:

```bash
kedro -v
kedro --verbose
```

Get help on Kedro commands:

```bash
kedro -h
kedro --help
```

Create a new kedro project:

```bash
kedro new
```

See the Kedro API documentation (including the tutorial):

```bash
kedro docs
```

## Project-specific Kedro commands

### `kedro run`
Runs the `main()` function in `run.py` (`src/project-name/run.py`)

To make sure the project is shareable and reproducible, you should maintain the `kedro run` program definitions in the `kedro_cli.py` to point to the entry point in your project.

### `kedro install`
Install all package dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

### `kedro test`
Run all `pytest` unit tests found in `src/tests`, including coverage (see the file `.coveragerc`).

### `kedro package`
Package your application as one `.egg` file  and one `.whl` file within the `src/dist/` folder of your project. For further information about packaging for Python, documentation is provided [here](https://packaging.python.org/overview/).

### `kedro build-docs`
Build the project documentation using the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) framework. To further customise it, please refer to `docs/source/conf.py` and the [corresponding section](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html) of the Sphinx documentation.

### `kedro jupyter notebook`, `kedro jupyter lab`, `kedro ipython`
Start a Jupyter Notebook, Lab or REPL session respectively.

Every time you start or restart a notebook kernel, a startup script (`<project-root>/.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-kedro-init.py`) will add the following variables in scope:
- `context` (Instance of `ProjectContext` class defined in `src/project-name/run.py`) (The details of how to use `context` can be found [here](../04_user_guide/11_ipython.md))
- `startup_error` (`Exception`)

To reload these at any point in your notebook (e.g. if you updated `catalog.yml`) use the line magic `%reload_kedro`.

This [line magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#line-magics) can be also used to see the error message if any of the variables above are undefined.

### `kedro jupyter convert`
Copy the code from cells [tagged](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#cell-tags) with `node` tag into Python files under `src/<package_name>/nodes/` in a Kedro project.

### `kedro activate-nbstripout`
Typically output cells of Jupyter Notebook should not be tracked by git, especially if they contain sensitive information.

This command adds a `git hook` which clears all notebook output cells before committing anything to `git`.  This needs to run only once per local repository.

## Using Python
You can also invoke the Kedro CLI as a Python module:

```console
python -m kedro
```
