## Installation guide

We recommend installing Kedro in a new virtual environment for *each* of your projects. To install Kedro:

```bash
pip install kedro
```

To check that Kedro is installed:

```bash
kedro info
```

You should see an ASCII art graphic and the Kedro version number. For example:

If you do not see the graphic displayed, or have any issues with your installation, see the [FAQs](../06_resources/01_faq.md) for help.
